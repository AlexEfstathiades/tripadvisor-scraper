735085875,Standing room only,"We hadn’t been to the Royal Opera House before and had no idea that some tickets are sold with no seats at all. Instead there is a rail that fences you in very securely and you can sort of slump against it. The places were cheap but there could have been one kind of fold down seats or an uncomfortable bench. We went to see La Traviata and it is very long.During the first interval we went to the Champagne bar where we drill had to stand! During the second interval there was also nowhere to sit.The production was very good and the view was restricted but not too bad.So please Royal Opera House provide more of a warning as people buy the tickets. Something needs to pop up explaining that the tickets are standing only and do I still want to buy them, because it is a very unpleasant shock which I’m sure many others have suffered too.",2.0,2019-12-28,Emer C,11,"Braintree, Regno Unito",1, dicembre 2019

734420093,La bella addormentata al Royal Opera House,"Questo è un posto speciale e sempre una vera delizia da visitare.Ho prenotato questa esibizione come regalo di compleanno per mia moglie e famiglia. Abbiamo mangiato nel ristorante Piazza e abbiamo avuto il box numero 98 per noi quattro.La cena è stata deliziosa e il servizio era eccellente. Il dessert viene servito durante l'intervallo che normalmente va bene, ma dato che i nostri posti erano dall'altra parte del Teatro dell'Opera e lo spettacolo era esaurito, quando siamo tornati al ristorante abbiamo scoperto che dovevamo affrettarci per finire il nostro pasto e tornare ai nostri posti in tempo.Se stai mangiando nel ristorante, prova a prenotare i posti sul lato sud dell'auditorium o nel mezzo.La vista dal Box 98 è leggermente limitata per quelli seduti dietro e due di noi hanno dovuto alzarsi per vedere l'80% del palco. Quelli seduti davanti probabilmente vedranno circa il 90% del palco.La performance è stata meravigliosa e meravigliosa, un'esperienza meravigliosa in un ambiente straordinario.",5.0,2019-12-24,James C M,33,"Maidstone, Regno Unito",9, dicembre 2019

733419442,Ce n'è sempre uno!,"Innanzitutto, adoro il Riyal Opera House su così tanti livelli. - probabilmente il mio posto preferito.Ieri sera siamo andati all'inaugurazione di La Traviata, che era gloriosa con scenografie sontuose, musica meravigliosa, ecc.Al secondo intervallo il mio amico mi aveva ordinato un bicchiere di vino che potevo solo prendere un sorso o due perché stavo guidando. Ho avuto un primo sorso e ho messo il bicchiere pieno su un tavolo vuoto dietro di me e poco dopo mi sono reso conto di un movimento, quindi sono andato a recuperare il mio bicchiere. Mentre mi voltavo, ero in tempo per vedere una coppia ben sbucciata scambiare il mio bicchiere pieno con uno dei loro che era circa un terzo pieno. I tre bicchieri si toccavano e lui li aveva appena scambiati! Borbottò qualcosa sul fatto che gli occhiali fossero vicini ma non alterò il suo corso d'azione.In ogni caso non sono negativo in merito al ROH, ma devo dire di essere un po 'attento a qualche comportamento di bassa vita da parte della clientela ovviamente benestante.",5.0,2019-12-18,moose065,109,oxford,51, dicembre 2019

734420093,The Sleeping Beauty at the Royal Opera House,"This is a special place and always such a treat to visit.I booked this performance as a birthday treat for my wife and family. We ate in the Piazza Restaurant and had Box number 98 for the four of us.The dinner was lovely and service was excellent. Dessert is served during the intermission which normally is fine, but as our seats were on the other side of the Opera House and the performance was sold out, we found by the time we got back to the restaurant we had to rush to finish our meal and get back to our seats in time. If you're eating in the restaurant, try and reserve seats on the South side of the auditorium or in the middle.The view from Box 98 is slightly restricted for those sitting at the back and two of us had to stand to see 80% of the stage. Those sitting at the front probably get to see about 90% of the stage.The performance was amazing and beautiful, a wonderful experience in an amazing setting.",5.0,2019-12-24,James C M,33,"Maidstone, Regno Unito",9, dicembre 2019

733419442,There’s always one!,"Firstly I absolutely love The Riyal Opera House on so many levels.-  probably my favourite place.Last night we went to the opening of La Traviata which was glorious with sumptuous sets, wonderful music etc.At the second interval my friend had ordered me a glass of wine that I could only take a sip or two from because I was driving. I had one first sip and put the full glass onto an empty table behind me and shortly after I became aware of a some movement so I went to retrieve my glass. As I turned I was in time to see a well heeled couple swap my full glass for one of theirs that was about a third full. The three glasses were touching each other and he just swapped them!  He muttered something about the glasses being close together but didn’t alter his course of action.I am not being negative in anyway about  the ROH but to say to be a bit careful about some low life behaviour from obviously well to do clientele.",5.0,2019-12-18,moose065,109,oxford,51, dicembre 2019
731819411,Un teatro histórico y  una gran programación,"El teatro es una maravilla, histórico, no hay más que leer un poco de su historia para darse cuenta de las grandes estrellas que han actuado en su escenario, desde Joan Sutherland a Margot Fonteyn , desde María Callas a Plácido Domingo. El teatro es verdaderamente precioso tanto por fuera como por dentro, así que aunque uno no tenga entradas para un espectáculo, vale la pena verlo por fuera y hacer fabulosas fotografías. Yo asistí a varias funciones durante mi estancia en Londres, así que aproveché el viaje¡¡¡ precios? hay para todos los bolsillos, verdaderamente, así que no hay excusa, el que quiere ver una ópera o un ballet, puede verlo a precios económicos, lógicamente, no será una visión del escenario tan completa como precios más caros, pero sinceramente, el teatro ofrece opciones para todos los gustos. Programación? perfecta¡¡¡ ópera y ballet, de todos los estilos, todo el repertorio y lo mejor de todo, muchas funciones, así que cuando uno va a Londres siempre tiene la suerte de tener función en el Royal Opera House, eso es lo genial de este teatro.",5.0,2019-12-10,santissd2014,49,"Provincia di Barcellona, Spagna",13, novembre 2019
731550500,Top tips,This is an iconic theatre and to enjoy your visit I recommend the following:Make sure of your transport arrangements before and after the show.  Leave time to walk around the whole theatre to see all the architecture.  Order food well in advance if you want to eat there.  Be prepared for longish queues at the cloakroom after the show.  Note that some of the lavatories (restrooms) may need to be accessed by lift if you can’t manage stairs.It’s a great experience.,5.0,2019-12-09,Alan F,1181,"Bournemouth, Regno Unito",261, dicembre 2019
730183430,A disappointing visit at the Royal opera ,"We love going to the opera and we were very excited when we snatched up a ticket for the Zauberflöte at the Royal Opera at Coventry Garden. We thought we are in for a special treat First impression of the lobby was so so , because we entered  a restaurant. We understand that for theses institutions it is difficult to break even but do you have to install    So many tables for a dinner before the performance?After we checked our seats , up in the sky, they were very uncomfortable .If you are 5ft 10 inches and more , please do not book at the gallery. This is worse than sitting out a sermon in an old Lutheran church. About the performance , we could not complain but a shorter version , as they do at the Met , would be nice. The artist were all good and the Queen of the Night outstanding.",3.0,2019-12-02,GarryausPs,105,"Princess Anne, Maryland",28, novembre 2019
729990519,Backstage tour,Excellent backstage tour.Didnt know what to expect but the whole experience was great learned so much about the opera house and the history if the opera and ballet.The young lady guide who had a French named but said to call her Andy was just lovely and clearly delighted in her job.The tour was on my bucket list.Its great value for money as well.We had a drink in the upstairs bar after the tour excellent service and from all members of staff including both the shops.Cant wait now to go to a performance.Thank you to all for a really enjoyable afternoon.,5.0,2019-12-01,liz l,162,"Broadstairs, Regno Unito",50, dicembre 2019

729634483,Fantastic back stage tour.,We joined a group of approximately 20 people for a backstage tour. Melinina was a most charming guide who was incredibly informative and took the group into the auditorium followed by seeing the ballet dancers rehearsing in one of the studios. We saw how the scenery is designed and the amazing way that it is moved around the stage between scenes. We would recommend this to anyone interested in the background logistics of this amazing Royal Opera House.,5.0,2019-11-01,Diana B,49,"Witney, Regno Unito",24, novembre 2019

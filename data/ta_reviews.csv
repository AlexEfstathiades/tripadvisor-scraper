776743729,Castle After Dark! (Halloween special!),"I treated my new boyfriend to the Halloween special 'Castle after Dark' at Warwick Castle.I thought the admission tickets were a great price, so I added a dungeon tour too! It was about £65 for both admission + dungeon (for 2 people), which was a good price for 4 hours of spooky fun before the 10pm curfew and well worth it ! We even booked a cheap Premier Inn in Warwick for £31 so we could enjoy a drink at the event! Excellent decorations and set up - lots of actors which was great and really made it! The courtyard looked brilliant with the projector lights, and the spooky maze was AMAZING! It was super scary and we didn't expect it!! :) 100% love these events at Warwick Castle, after doing the Dragon Slayer last summer too! Only downside to the event this year was the wait to get a drink. Due to COVID restrictions it was all table service and the poor waiting team were rushed off their feet and being moaned at by people for waiting. We waited patiently for 30 minutes before anyone came to us. You had to hold up the menu to say you were ready and we had to swap arms between us because it was achy after a while! But sadly it started to rain and there weren't any umbrellas or anything in the courtyard which put a little bit of a downer on waiting patiently getting wet. But the staff when they came were apologetic and so lovely! Would have helped if they had more support and the general public weren't so rude!",5.0,8 Nov,Hatii,/Profile/Hatii,3,,4, October 2020
776390372,No Castle after dark,"We have done Halloween at Warwick for a number of years and was disappointed this year because of Merlins attitude to its pass holders. It was a mare to get tickets as a pass holder as they were not available for that week but if I paid could get them, many emails later got some. Up until this year your pass/ticket allowed you to stay until 9pm to enjoy the castle after dark. But when we arrived realised had to leave by 5pm as now charging £10 a head to stay after dark! Only extra could see for the price were street food sellers and tables. Shame as use to be really good at Halloween. We enjoyed the shows, haunted hallows and Castle but Merlin have spolt it!",3.0,3 Nov,hms02,/Profile/hms02,58,"Kent, United Kingdom",18, October 2020

776161729,Castle after dark,"Warwick castle after dark... within the first two minutes the headless lords page gave a good fright, nothing compared to his screech through the portcullis! State rooms were great, the lighting was perfect. Then onto the dungeons, which was quite frankly terrible, but only because I wish id brought fresh underwear! Great evening even with social distancing, still very involving. Drinks were as expensive as they could be ofcourse, but you would be naive not to have anticipated as such. The castle looked formidable, and also props to the knight in the main courtyard, seemed to be enjoying themselves which certainly made me feel welcome.",5.0,Oct 2020,Brent R,/Profile/brentr585,3,,0, October 2020
776100054,Disappointing & expensive,"There’s no denying it is a beautiful place to visit, but make sure you take out a small loan before attending!As a family of four (two kids aged 10&8) it was over £70 to get in, then you need to pay for the dungeons, another £40 then the spooky experience was also ticketed inside (didn’t check prices) £5 per child for Archery, to join in with the Knights school you had to but a sword, the money kept mounting up! Food was nice but £7 for a kids sandwich meal was a little OTT especially as they ran out of popcorn!The Halloween event wasnt very atmospheric, didn’t feel like much effort was put in apart from the maze which was the highlight!

775973849,4th and Last Halloween Visit,"This was our 4th visit for Halloween. Very disappointed and will not be returning. All previous visits have been amazing and in previous visits we spent all day and until late at night at the castle, with many activities to keep us busy. Didn’t realise when I purchased this break that the tickets only allowed us access until 5pm and we would have to pay the same again if we wanted to stay for the evening. This has not been the case in previous visits. This time, all activities (greatly reduced) were focussed on very small children with nothing for the older ones (mine are 11 and 12). We had done everything of interest by lunch time so left for our hotel. Only going back the next day because I had pre-booked tickets for the dungeon on that day.

775933544,Castle Not Tourist friendly,"We visited Warwick castle in October 2020. While visiting Stow on the Wold, we purchased our tickets to visit the castle from a Tourist Information Office. The person selling the tickets assured us that the email we recieved on our smartphone  should be sufficient for admission to the castle. On reaching the castle, the staff insisted that the email was not enough, they wanted a printed copy of the ticket. We found this a ridiculous situation, It took us half an hour to gain entry to the castle. With an expensive ticket (no concession rates for seniors) there was no guide or map to the castle and grounds. To access the cafe, one has to pass through the dungeons area, which was another awkward moment especially when it was raining. We found the staff very unfriendly and not helpful to tourist.

775792780,Won't be visiting again,"Very disappointed with our visit today. Considering we paid £78 for 4 Halloween tickets, expecting something spectacular, only to see 4 Halloween characters walking around, a few pumpkins, and if you wanted to visit the dungeon it was an extra £8 each. There was very few places to buy food, which may i add was greatly overpriced. The weather was awful, which I know nothing can be done about, but there was little or nowhere to shelter. I completely understand the covid restrictions etc, but a couple of open sided marquees would have been helpful, to at least get some shelter - obviously monitored for amount of people and adhering to social distancing. I felt there was very little social distancing and very long ques. Then there was the added bonus of a £6  parking charge upon leaving. I'm pretty sure we won't be visiting again",2.0,Oct 2020,Emma C,/Profile/Madem81,2,,2, October 2020

My children were very scared by a very realistic headless horseman by the queue to get in and it went downhill from there. Couldn't escape Halloween, very little information on what was available to see and do. I hoped we'd learn a bit about the castle and some English history but no real information. We went through the Kingmaker exhibition, which seemed like it could have been good but it was just loud and confused. Falconer's Quest was excellent but otherwise the experience was a waste of time and money. Very disappointing.",2.0,Oct 2020,Savingup4,/Profile/Savingup4,9,All over,4, October 2020
775722770,"Overpriced,  too busy, tacky tourist attraction","After the very long walk from the car park we queued up for ten minutes to get in.  Once inside the grounds we queued for the toilets, people crammed in, no social distancing whatsoever.Then queued for the main hall.  No tour guides inside to tell you anything about the castle. Have to read the information which is no good for children and difficult when there are so many people waiting behind you.The Spooky event was a timed slot.  Our time was 115pm.  We  got there at 1.05 thinking by the time we had queued it would be 1 15.  We were told to come back at 1.15.  At 1.15 we returned to the most enormous, non socially distanced queue stretching back to the portcullis entrance.  Finally got in at 140.  Once inside it was fine for younger children but only a 5 minute attraction.Plenty of tables outside to eat on but only the chippy and coffee stalls open. Lots of other places to get food from were there but they were shut.So for £100 for a family of 5 plus £6 parking which is a total rip off , I would say dont bother, save your money.  Apparently they are limiting numbers, I would hate to go on a normal day.  Far too many people. A fabulous old castle, ruined by the mighty Merlin who've made it into a naff theme park experience.  What a shame.  You even had to pay extra for the dungeons!We left after 3 hours and went to Broadway, a much better way to spend your time and money!Ps we did like the headless horseman though!",2.0,Oct 2020,Yorks171,/Profile/Yorks171,26,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",20, October 2020

Clear one way systems and stewarding was very good. Not all visitors kept the distancing, but that’s not the fault of the staff.Excellent choice of activities. Entertainment on centre stage fantastic, especially the witches, who appeared several times. Zomba great fun!

775680441,Disappointing and Pricey,"I was quite disappointed to be honest, the organisation of activities and lack of simple signage led to confusion and unnecessary queues, partly due I recognise to the Covid problems, however a staff member did recognise that there were issues but beyond that could not really help. I last visited the castle over 30 years ago and my recollection is that I had a much more enjoyable day then than I had this time.One tip if you are visiting, we had some food in the undercroft cafe and for some reason this was remarkably quiet compared to the outside catering units even though the prices were the same and the weather was unpredictable. It may be worth trying there first, as there were sizeable queues at other places and we were able to walk in, order and sit down straight away.",3.0,Oct 2020,Alistair C,/Profile/919alistairc,2,,0, October 2020
775674342,Good day out ,We visited for the Halloween event from Southampton. We had not been to the castle before but found it interesting and fun. We noticed that some people weren’t wearing masks or adhering to social distancing but staff were attempting to keep us safe. I felt it was a bit of a rip off to have to pay for parking on top of the admission price. The highlight was the Falconary show as they had many more birds than we had seen before. It was nice to have a spooky show for the kids to watch and there were additional events for on offer.

775610656,MEDIEVAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"With this historic castle being run by an entertainment group, you’d expect lots of fun and they deliver. The falconry show is spectacular. There’s little shows for the kids and big shows for the parents, all well done by actors who must be thrilled to be working. The climb to one of the towers or the Norman mound is well worth the view. Booking ahead is required in these difficult times.

775523948,Haunted Castle Day ticket,"This was a mostly fabulous day out.  It was pretty rainy and cold but that meant on a Saturday it was quietish.  We arrived after 2 as we had lunch in Warwick first and unfortunately as you have to book times for everything we missed out on a couple of events we would have liked to attend and for £27 each it was an expensive ticket.  We loved doing the archery (£5 each extra) and the Falcons Quest was amazing.  We had to stand in the muddy field as, because of Covid, half the benches couldn't be used.  We did notice a lot of disregard for Social distancing but it is not the fault of staff - people need to take responsibility for their own actions and a lot just don't.  I do have a little gripe about the parking - I tried to check which was the closest to the castle and could only find conflicting info mostly recommending St Nicholas.  Well  I was surprised to find the stables carpark right at the entrance  Obviously it was full by the time we got there but if you go early and have mobility issues, this is the closest.  We loved the day out and I would thoroughly recommend it.",4.0,Oct 2020,LIZVEALL,/Profile/LVeall,8,,0, October 2020
775450915,Poor Social Distancing and Covid-19 Safety,"We’ve been visiting Warwick Castle for Halloween for the past three years so despite Covid-19 we still had high hopes and confidence in the safety measures taken — especially from the information we had seen prior to visiting. Unfortunately upon arriving at the event we immediately felt uncomfortable and were shocked at the lack of procedures and safety measures taken. The queues were very long (even before entering) and there was zero social distancing and the majority of visitors were not wearing masks. The queues at the food stalls were all over the place with people gathering - again, with no masks. We even walked past members of staff trying to decided how to deal with this and whether to have barriers on the night. I’d have expected safety measures to have been thought out thoroughly beforehand. The benches in the centre were also fairly packed together. The man behind the halloumi fries bar was not even wearing a mask when making and serving the food. I am very disappointed and didn’t feel I could enjoy the experience as I felt I had made a poor decision and put myself and my partner at risk. It would have been better if social distancing was enforced in queues and if masks were made mandatory when queuing, also. I do think more work needs to be done to ensure they’re helping prevent the spread of Covid-19.",2.0,Oct 2020,Charlotte,/Profile/charlotte_8996,1,,0, October 2020

Our original plan was to spend one day at the Castle and another in Stratford but we filled both days and had so much fun. The highlights were the Falconers Quest which we watched twice as it was amazing and the Warwick Dungeons which you had to pay more for but scared me out of my wits!!!

775234345,A huge castle,Its a huge castle and is well looked after. But seems hard to justify the very highly priced tickets. Limited activities possibly due to current covid restrictions but still a good place to visit none the less.

775006685,"Save your money. Beautiful castle ruined by tacky displays, muzak & bad food",Dismaland!  This incredibly beautiful castle tackified with hideous muzak and sound effects. Even the staff were complaining about having to suffer it day in and day out.  For £52 for two people we felt completely fleeced.  We walked miles from the car park to the castle and walked through the gift store filled with plastic tack.  The muzak shouted out in the entrance through crackly speakers.  The 'themed' maze fortunately had thin dead hedges which allowed us to escape the doorman's Disney voiceovers as quickly as possible. We entered the courtyard to hear the fake knights shouting in fake knight tones and more muzak rang from the house.  The house was filled with waxwork sets of people who lived/stayed in the house with crass explanations of the context (albeit this was not nearly as offensive as the muzak).  By this time we were hungry and went down to the basement to be greeted by a stench of fried food with only deep fried 'brown food' such as sausage roles available.  It made Greggs look like the Savoy. The pretty peacock garden was a great escape and this had a pretty team room ... with one plate of dried sandwiches and packaged cream teas available.  All the other concessions were closed.  It makes you ashamed to be British that this is what foreign visitors are offered.  There was a kitsch birds of prey display with more amateurish sound effects and music.  We felt so sorry for the poor birds being forced to perform circus tricks to a handful of miserable looking tourists - to the extent that we felt like coming back with banners saying 'free the birds'!  We really regretted going and wasting our money.  We wished we have simply walked down by the Avon and seen the beautiful castle in its splendour without the embarrassingly shoddy display.,1.0,Oct 2020,Manda B,/Profile/amandasF4232YA,20,"London, United Kingdom",11, October 2020

What I would really love to do is give a five star rating to the castle, and a huge five star rating to the Falconer's Quest birds of prey show - that was awesome.  The reason the rating is only three stars is that we paid the extra money for the dungeon experience which I thought was well reviewed and were extremely disappointed - the actors did fine, but the script was so crude it almost ruined the day out for me, and I was so disappointed I had subjected my kids (16 and 14 years old) and my husband to it.

773798169,Warwick Siege,"Overall, this was a great visit. The castle is beautiful and there are plenty of things to both see and do without paying for the supplementary activities such as archery.  Nevertheless, you do spend a significant amount of time outside and as such, need to carefully consider what you are wearing.In terms of costs, the car parking at £6 is reasonable. What is more difficult to accept is the children's lunch package - essentially a Tesco £3 meal deal for £7 and without the choice.With regard to the booking process, this is woeful. Warwick Castle currently has a £14 parent and toddler deal. Which represents great value. The ticketing option then allows you to add an additional toddler for £6 or an under 3 year old for nothing.  However, it says nothing about adding an extra adult. Going to the checkout shows that you have a 'Parent and Toddler ' ticket plus a 'free adult ticket'. Great I thought, two adults and a toddler for £14. Believing this to be too good to be true, I checked the FAQs  - nothing to be seen. If I attempted to call, then I would be charged 13p a minute for the privilege, so didn't bother with this.  So on arrival, I was told that the 'parent and toddler' ticket was for the toddler only and the free adult ticket was for the adult. Moreover, I ""should have realised that from the barcode being for one person."" We then had an embarrassing stand-off, where I pointed out that if you describe something as a parent and toddler ticket, then another thing as a free adult ticket, the assumption would be that this would allow 2 adults to enter the castle. Nope, this was all my fault and I needed to pay an additional £26 for the misleading website. In the end, the matter was resolved by a really helpful member of staff who was surprised by the poor level of information on the website.All in all, a great day, which represented good value overall, but was let down by a really poor website which lacked clarity and the high cost of food and beverages.",4.0,Oct 2020,Alex P,/Profile/604AlexP,51,"Rugby, United Kingdom",44, October 2020
773447047,Autumn ,"We spent a very enjoyable day today.  There are lots of Covid measures, probably helped by the fact it was not overly busy today so no crowds anywhere.  The falconry show was our highlight, so much so we watched it twice.  There was limited refreshment outlets open but more than adequate for the amount of people around. The grounds are beautiful with some majestic trees. There did appear to be limited activities but that did not detract for us being a couple with no children.",4.0,Oct 2020,Alison H,/Profile/AlisonH229,158,"Ballachulish, United Kingdom",26, October 2020
773407509,"Loved the maze, great fun",The wild bird show was excellent and at no extra charge.Food and drink was very expensive. Some of it was closed due to storm damage. It was very expensive to enter but it took a few hours to explore fully.,4.0,Oct 2020,Gaylene D,/Profile/gaylened2015,4,,0, October 2020
773403067,Warwick castle  day out,Had a lovely day out at Warwick castle  bird show was brilliant  The only thing that disappointed me was I really was looking forward to going down the dungeons  but you had to book online and not on the day I didn't know this because trip advisor didn't give me the option  so that spoilt my day,4.0,Oct 2020,Mandy,/Profile/Mandy1407,27,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",8, September 2020

773359674,Great day out,"Thoroughly enjoyed our day here.  The falconry display was excellent, as was the archery. We also had afternoon tea - absolutely delicious.  We couldn't finish it so had the leftovers in a box to take home.  It is a shame that some of it was closed due to storm damage but we walked all round and that included going up the towers.Allow plenty of time to enjoy everything and be aware that there is a lot of walking - it is a tiring day.The castle is quite something inside and the chandeliers are amazing.  Also have a good look at the carving out of a single piece of oak, quite stunning",4.0,Oct 2020,karen t,/Profile/493karent,80,"Taunton, United Kingdom",33, October 2020
773027217,Warwick Castle & Dungeons,"Had an excellent day at Warwick Castle despite the weather. The rainy day guarantee should cover it though and we will definitely go back if we can.It was a great meal at the conservatory. All the staff were really great and friendly. In particular, Tom in the gift shop next to the cafe was brilliant, he told us all about the swords and he had an incredible knowledge of history. He was able to answer our questions and it was great to see the genuine love for history that he had.It is a really great attraction for the price. The dungeons were very entertaining and get people involved with history. All the COVID measures seemed up to standard.All in all a great day out.",5.0,Oct 2020,Ethan S,/Profile/ethans30,8,,2, October 2020

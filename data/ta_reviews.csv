680584687,Nice One Hour Tour,No need to spend more than one hour on any Amsterdam canal cruise. Unless you like more time on the water of the one hour cruise it’s all the highlights. Friendly staff nice boat makes the trip easy. Consider buying an open ticket so you can leave it anytime.,2019-06-10 00:00:00,4.0,paulstikibar,61,"Canyon Lake, California"
680577115,Enjoyable tour ,The canal cruise is a perfect idea to spend time and to know about the famous building and places to plan your next attraction to visit.

680559229,Kjempefin båttur,"Supert med båttur langs Amsterdams kanaler. Veldig fin måte å se byen på, enten man tar turen alene, eller deler den i gode venners lag ",2019-06-10 00:00:00,5.0,Carla D,31,"Trondheim, Norway"
680534882,City canal tour ,We enjoyed our canal tour.  It gave us the opportunity to see parts of the city that we had not walked to.   It was a bit difficult to take pictures from the boat.  The recorded commentary was ok.   Overall a good experience.,2019-06-10 00:00:00,4.0,Pauline F,21,"Adelaide Hills, Australia"
680254994,A must to do activity in Amsterdam ,"During my recent Europe trip, I got the opportunity to do this activity as my tour operator arranged this for me.It was an see through cruise with around 60persons sitting. This canal cruise was around for 1 hour and covered almost every water way of Amsterdam. They provided with a headphone by which i got hear the commentary about the places which the cruise passed by.Sometimes the pilot also add some fun thing in the commentary which made the cruise ride more memorable. I really enjoyed the cruise ride and the way they elaborated the rich history of Amsterdam. If you are visiting Amsterdam, then it should be in the first number in the to do activity list.

680096948,Blue boat trip,We booked this online and received a discount. The ticket on my phone was scanned in the office at the boat and we were allocated a boat waiting. The cruise consisted of a commentary through earphones and the driver pointing at things. The most interesting for us was the many houseboats on the canals. It was good value for money if you book online for a no frills experience ,2019-06-08 00:00:00,4.0,marcusn279,18,"Lincoln, United Kingdom"
679954343,Toeristentopper,Als echte toerist kun je een dagje Amsterdam gewoonweg niet beleven zonder rondvaart over de grachtengordel. Met minstens 10 andere nationaliteiten wordt je in een bootje gepropt en ga je op weg!Als slingerend tussen de andere rondvaartboten door maak je een tocht door de grachtengordel. Een bandje vertelt wat bijzonderheden maar laat je ook met veel vragen zitten. Een perfecte vorm van vermaak voor het massatoerisme en zo onpersoonlijk mogelijk.Toch wilde ik het een keer meegemaakt hebben. Prettig is dat er een toilet aan boord is en je beschut zit tegen de regen.,2019-06-08 00:00:00,3.0,Irma M,435,"Eindhoven, The Netherlands"
679931830,Great canal trip,My friend & i went on one of the lovers cruise boats which was a 1 hour round trip of the canals with the pilot pointing out places of interest & there was also audio commentary in English. There is no bathroom on board so make sure you go before you get on. The cost was €12.50 per person as we had a discount voucher. It was a lovely day on our cruise and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend. ,2019-06-08 00:00:00,5.0,Sly29_11,87,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"

679236577,Don’t miss this mini cruise,Seeing Amsterdam from the other side (water side) gives a whole different perspective. The panaramic view of the canal side buildings and houses really tells the history. The cruise is normally about an hour. Translation of the guides comments is available in many languages. This event is still one of the best tourist spends in Amsterdam.,2019-06-05 00:00:00,5.0,Patrick R,220,"Bay Area Houston, Texas"
679001393,Beautiful historic cruise,This was an absolutely lovely cruise on a beautiful day. It was so relaxing and enjoying going to the waterways of Amsterdam while relaxing and chatting with friends. The audio guide was in several languages and was just very pleasurable To listen to while hearing the narrator tell of all these historic dates and times and places in the rich history of Amsterdam on the water. It was very well worth it and definitely money well worth spent,2019-06-04 00:00:00,5.0,azbone,6,
678958925,Relaxing,What a way to get around the city... best option is the hop on hop off which allows you the freedom to get around and do what you would enjoy... main concern was having a baby in the group with a push chair as you need the muscles to get it in and out ,2019-06-04 00:00:00,4.0,dalveerh,13,"Kericho, Kenya"
678952311,Boat trip on the canal in Amsterdam,We loved this trip so much we did it twice in three days. The compare was very well spoken and very knowledgeable.

678181681,One good way of seeing the town,"We took a canal cruise in the evening. It was a tour lasting 2 and half hour. As the hop on hop off bus does not give you a very convenient way of seeing the city the canal cruise lets you see the town from the comforts of your boat, while you sip your drink and have some snacks. One gets to see the old buildings and new as you sail down the canal. ",2019-06-01 00:00:00,4.0,KCJena900,930,"Mumbai, India"

679333238,Old Amsterdam (Jordaan),"Dit gedeelte van Amsterdam heeft een échte geschiedenis. Niet de geschiedenis die nu rond gaat. Nee, de Jordaan was een gedeelte van Amsterdam waar de gezinnen woonden die werkten bij de 'Rich & Famous' toendertijd. Gewoon werkvolk enzo. Alleen zat de wereld toen anders in elkaar. Als pa op vrijdag zijn salaris kreeg dan kon het zómaar gebeuren dat de rekening in de kroeg éérst betaald werd en er zeer weinig overbleef voor het gezin van ma en de vele kinderen. Een halve woning was normaal met 6 (of meer) personen omdat er gewoonweg niet meer te besteden was. Wél was er liefde en medeleven in de buurt. Toen-der-tijd 'hielp je elkaar' en was er geen 'vuile was die je buiten hing'. De hele buurt was gelijk en dat wilde je graag zo houden want ander was je een buitenbeentje en hoorde je niet meer bij de 'club'. Over de Amsterdamse 'Jordaan' is zoveel meer te vertellen.Volgende keer maar weer een beetje meer.Groet Ton, Photodam.nl",2019-06-05 00:00:00,4.0,Tony-ASD,3,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands"

Este tour en particular ha sido uno de mis favoritos, en parte gracias a la guía, Anabel. Es una chica española que, además de conocer muy bien la historia, arquitectura, gastronomía y cultura de la ciudad, aporta mucho más que datos. De partida, te da su opinión honesta sobre las principales atracciones turísticas. Así puedes tomar una decisión informada. Además, se nota y agradece su energía y pasión en el desarrollo del tour. Pero por sobre todo, me encantó que tuviese su propio discurso, su propia opinión, respecto a temas que quizás otras personas prefieren contar demasiado imparcialmente. Me atrevo a decir que Anabel me inspiró, porque dice las cosas como son, de manera entretenida, pero también con un objetivo de ""marcar"" a las personas y dejarles una reflexión.Si es que pueden elegir el guía, les recomendaría que sí o sí intenten hacerlo con ella!",2019-06-08 00:00:00,5.0,SanchezPipe,11,"Santiago, Chile"

It's a great narrative that drives home the human aspects of these often ill-understood industries, and refreshing to hear even as a local. It wasn't the most history heavy tour, and I honestly believe that's for the best as you cannot do this unique part of town justice by just summarizing notable events.

From the brief overview of Amsterdam history, the cruising itself, the humorous and informative commentary (given in English) during the ride, to the drinks and bites (a bit of an upcharge), this venture was a highlight of our trip. Our booking request was answered in a timely manner. They even worked with a couple of other fellow cruisers to provide a special treat for a birthday. We opted for the open boat cruise with 8 people in a small boat. There was an intimacy and personal touch to that which enriched the experience. The captain was excellent in speaking when necessary but also being quiet at times and just letting us all soak in the environment. We chose to pay for the drinks and bites, but the website indicates you may bring your own if you are willing to share. This cruise is a bit more expensive than others, but we got what we paid for.

It was a unique experience, but a bit of a let down... I think I had my expectations too high. The gist of the experience is when you arrive you are given 3 drink tokens that are included with your price of admission. 1 is for using in the lobby bar area which is a very typically bar. The other 2 are for inside the Ice Bar. We had 8pm tickets and arrived about 7:45 and ordered our first round of drinks from the lobby bar. It took a bit to get our first round, which ended up being a little bit of an issue. The show started promptly which I appreciated, but we were not allowed to take our lobby bar drinks into the Ice bar, so bottoms up! To start the show there is a movie you watch in the lobby to get you in the spirit of things (I think you're supposed to be a pirate or something like that). You then get suited up. They give you a pair of gloves and a down jacket to wear. The Ice Bar itself is a walk in freezer with a few ice carvings and such and a bar. Nowhere to really sit (not that you would want to). You then line up at the bar to get your first Ice Bar drink. There are basically 3 options- beer, a shot of flavored vodka, or a glass of OJ. They are all served in glasses made of ice. I started with a beer (Heineken was the only option) and my wife had a shot. For our second drink we got an OJ and a shot of Vodka and attempted to mix our own screw drivers, but that didn't work out so well. We grabbed a few pics and then off we went. So yes, it was unique experience, but I wouldn't call it a exceptional. The staff were all super friendly though and in the spirit. I would have enjoyed it much more had I gotten to enjoy my first drink in the lobby and if there had been more drink choices in the actual Ice Bar.",2019-06-05 00:00:00,3.0,Chris P,5,"Conway, Arkansas"

678817668,Pretty neat but,"We went here the end of May. The experience was fun and neat but the instructions were bad. The ticketa said enjoy a canal cruise then enjoy drinks at the ice bar. What really happened was ypu go to thw ice bar first and have your drinks then have to go to another part of the city for thw canal tour. Plan accordingly.

I considered doing one of the boat tours with one of the larger boat companies but was glad I took this tour. The boat itself sat around 25 people comfortably and the staff was very nice and attentive.

680570801,So enjoyable!,"We were just walking past the Anne Frank house when we spotted these guys so we hopped on. David and Julia were the crew for our trip and they were fantastic, so informative, really warm and friendly, and they made the hour long tour so enjoyable with their entertaining repartee. I wanted to go on one of the smaller, more personal boats (rather than one of the huge enclosed boats) for exactly these reasons and I’m so glad I did. We could ask questions about what we were seeing and what they were telling us at any stage and we were encouraged to do so. We even had an impromptu bonus performance of a man walking a tightrope over a section of one canal as we snaked our way along. It was Bizarre, but he made it thankfully! It cost €16 for the hour long tour (we paid as we disembarked) and it was worth every cent of that, you could also purchase a beer, wine or soft drink onboard if you liked...and we liked!I would highly recommend this tour company and if you have David and Julia as your captain and first mate you will be very well looked after, expertly entertained and far more informed about Amsterdam afterwards than you were before you boarded!

Without a doubt, this is the best company to cruise the canals with if you want an experience that doesn't make you feel like a tourist being herded through the attractions.",2019-06-08 00:00:00,5.0,erndog2019,1,

679976559,Flagship Amsterdam,"It was nice - lively and very pleasant. The young crew did their best to entertain. They emphasized, that they were relatively new in the business - so one wee piece advice: A little bit more cultural info will be helpful. Ene though = we thoroughly enjoyed the hour fully and can recommend the trip - it is individual.",2019-06-08 00:00:00,4.0,Departure25825449771,1,"London, United Kingdom"

679880321,Good,It was a decent ride. Lizzy and her partner had a nice sense of humor as well. There were also options to pick a nice drink.,2019-06-08 00:00:00,4.0,isha m,1,
679851188,Cheerful and informative cruise,"Guides Lodewijk and Sophie were fantastic and cheerful. For about half the time on board we were allowed to throw in questions we had about Amsterdam, then they answered and throw humor and insider tips here and there back to us. I think the little personal things they did (such as helping us by loading and unloading, approaching us one by one for drink orders, and asking where we are from and replying back in their native language to break the ice) are what makes this tour stand out compared to counterparts along the canal. P.S.: Just in case you couldn't make it to the booked cruise time, you can still able to squeeze in at a later or earlier time, as long as there are no long lines. The cruises leave frequently like every 15 or 30 minutes during the summer.",2019-06-07 00:00:00,5.0,aswiratama,5,Jakarta
